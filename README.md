# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning
Machine learning is an increasingly important field, but it is usually not taught in biology and other non computer scienc departments to undergraduate students. For this reason we have created a beginner-friendly
introduction to machine learning focused on a simple algorythm (Decision Trees) and a relevant COVID dataset from counties in California. The material is made accessible by using cloud-computing platforms 
and Google Colab, which means that all a student needs to participate is a browser window. The tutorial includes pre-written code, practice material, an answer key, all accompanied by a series of short 
and friendly videos by the makers of this material. Surveys at San Francisco State University showed that after doing the tutorial, biology and chemistry students were interested to learn more about machine learning.
Below we can see some of these results.
